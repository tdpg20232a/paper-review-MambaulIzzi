<h1> Augmented Reality Map Navigation with Freehand Gestures </h1>
This paper examines the use of freehand gestures for digital map navigation in Augmented Reality (AR), with a focus on improving user experience and reducing arm fatigue. This research explores new techniques for multiscale navigation, such as pan and zoom, using disembodied horizontal map displays. This study also evaluates the influence of hand dominance (unimanual and bimanual) and input mapping (position-based and rate-based) on user performance and comfort during multiscale navigation. The results show that transitions between input mappings can reduce perceived arm fatigue without sacrificing user performance.

This research focuses on the use of freehand movements for multiscale navigation in Augmented Reality (AR) applications, especially in the context of digital map exploration. By exploring the benefits of integrating position- and velocity-based input mapping, this research aims to improve user experience and reduce arm fatigue during navigation tasks. The introduction of new hybrid techniques, such as DiveZoom and TerraceZoom, allows seamless transitions between different input mappings, providing a good balance between performance, comfort and ease of learning for users. The research findings show that this hybrid method can effectively improve the usability of AR applications for map navigation, paving the way for more intuitive and ergonomic interaction methods in the future.

The research method used in this study involves a series of steps to explore the use of freehand gestures in digital map navigation with AR. The following is a general description of the research methods carried out:

1. **Preliminary Exploration**: Research begins with an exploration of the use of free hand gestures in digital map navigation, with a focus on the use of hand gestures in the air with AR.

2. **User Study**: A user study was conducted to explore the effects of hand dominance (unimanual and bimanual) and input mapping (position-based and rate-based) on user performance and comfort during multiscale navigation.

3. **Hybrid Technique Development**: Based on findings from user studies, two new hybrid techniques, namely DiveZoom and TerraceZoom, were designed, which enable a smooth transition between position-based and rate-based input mapping.

4. **Design Evaluation**: An evaluation was carried out on the hybrid engineering design developed to evaluate performance, comfort and ease of learning for users.

5. **Result Analysis**: Results from the evaluation are used to analyze the effectiveness of the hybrid technique in reducing perceived arm fatigue without compromising user performance.

Using this approach, the research succeeded in identifying the benefits of integrating position-based and rate-based input mapping in improving the user experience in digital map navigation with AR.
